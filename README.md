# Quick tutorials
Tutorials for popular analyses. These tutorials are intended to be short and quick resources.

**Gene overlap enrichment:** This tutorial shows how to statistically test and report overlaps between gene sets. It requires two lists of gene sets (e.g markers of each cell types for tissue A (gene list 1) and for tissue B (gene list 2)). The tutorial also has a function that generates a basic bubble chart of statistics.

**Gene overlap enrichment and depletion:** Same as 'gene overlap enrichment' but also tests for depletion (whether the overlap is significantly lower than expected by chance).

**Gene ontology enrichment:** Performs gene ontology (molecular function, biological process, cellular component) enrichment tests using clusterProfiler. Also shows how to plot the enrichment statistics from multiple comparisons.

**Visualization of gene set overlaps:** Venn diagram (two or three gene sets) or upset plots (>3 gene sets) to visualize overlaps between gene sets.
