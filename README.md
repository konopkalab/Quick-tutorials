**Gene overlap enrichment:** This tutorial shows how to statistically test and report overlaps between gene sets. It requires two lists of gene sets (e.g markers of each cell types for tissue A (gene list 1) and for tissue B (gene list 2)). The tutorial also has a function that generates a basic bubble chart of statistics.

**Gene ontology enrichment:** Performs gene ontology (molecular function, biological process, cellular component) enrichment tests using clusterProfiler. Also shows how to plot the enrichment statistics from multiple comparisons.
